# Code Complexity Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report identifies areas of high complexity in the Python codebase and provides concrete suggestions for simplification. The analysis found several key issues:

1. **Large Files**: Multiple files exceed 1000 lines, indicating accumulated complexity
2. **Complex Functions**: Several functions have cyclomatic complexity > 30
3. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Classes with 20+ methods indicate multiple responsibilities
4. **Deep Nesting**: Complex control flow with multiple levels of conditionals
5. **Configuration Complexity**: Complex initialization patterns in core components

## 1. Complex Functions/Methods

### DAGExecutor.executeDAG (src/core/dag_executor.py, line 667)
- **Complexity Score**: 50
- **Size**: 378 lines
- **Issues**:
  - Multiple nested conditionals and loops
  - Handles too many concerns: validation, state management, execution, templating
  - Complex error handling with multiple exception types
  - Deep nesting levels (up to 5-6 levels)

**Suggestions**:
1. Extract validation logic to a separate method
2. Create dedicated methods for template processing
3. Split connection resolution into a separate phase
4. Use a state machine pattern for execution flow
5. Extract parallel execution logic to a separate class

### PluginInputResolver.resolve_inputs (src/core/plugin_input_resolver.py, line 20)
- **Complexity Score**: 33
- **Size**: 206 lines
- **Issues**:
  - Complex input gathering from multiple sources
  - Nested conditionals for type checking
  - Multiple fallback mechanisms

**Suggestions**:
1. Create input source strategies (ContextSource, ExtrasSource, etc.)
2. Use chain of responsibility pattern for input resolution
3. Extract validation logic to separate methods

### DAGExecutor._run_with_retries (src/core/dag_executor.py, line 423)
- **Complexity Score**: 30
- **Size**: 232 lines
- **Issues**:
  - Complex retry logic mixed with execution logic
  - Multiple error types handled inline
  - State management scattered throughout

**Suggestions**:
1. Extract retry logic to a RetryManager class
2. Use decorator pattern for retry behavior
3. Centralize error categorization

## 2. Code Duplication Patterns

### Progress Reporting
- **Files**: 23 files contain TaskManager update calls
- **Pattern**: Similar progress reporting logic repeated across modules
- **Example**: `task_manager.update_step_progress()` calls with similar parameters

**Suggestions**:
1. Create a ProgressReporter abstraction
2. Use observer pattern for progress updates
3. Centralize progress formatting logic

### Context Handling
- **Pattern**: Repeated checks for context type and attribute existence
- **Example**:
  ```python
  if hasattr(context, "get_data"):
      data = context.get_data()
  elif hasattr(context, "extras"):
      data = context.extras
  ```

**Suggestions**:
1. Create a unified context interface
2. Use adapter pattern for different context types
3. Remove need for runtime type checking

## 3. Overly Complex Class Hierarchies

### Plugin System
- **Base Classes**: PluginBase, multiple loader classes, executor classes
- **Issues**: 
  - Deep inheritance chains
  - Multiple mixin classes
  - Complex initialization patterns

**Suggestions**:
1. Favor composition over inheritance
2. Use dependency injection instead of inheritance for shared behavior
3. Simplify to a single plugin interface with capabilities

### Context Classes
- **Classes**: PipelineContext, ExecutionContext, EnhancedContext
- **Issues**:
  - Overlapping responsibilities
  - Complex delegation patterns
  - State synchronization issues

**Suggestions**:
1. Merge similar contexts into one
2. Use clear ownership for state management
3. Remove delegation anti-patterns

## 4. Poor Separation of Concerns

### Classes with Too Many Responsibilities

1. **ArtifactManager** (25 methods)
   - File operations
   - Metadata management
   - Serialization
   - Path management

2. **TaskManager** (22 methods)
   - State persistence
   - Progress tracking
   - History management
   - Query operations

3. **PluginSandboxContext** (66 methods across 3 classes)
   - Security enforcement
   - Resource management
   - API proxying
   - State tracking

**Suggestions**:
1. Apply Single Responsibility Principle
2. Extract cohesive method groups to separate classes
3. Use facade pattern for complex APIs

## 5. Complex Configuration/Initialization

### DAGExecutor.__init__
- **Issues**:
  - 15+ instance variables initialized
  - Complex conditional initialization
  - Tight coupling to multiple components

**Suggestions**:
1. Use builder pattern for complex initialization
2. Extract configuration to separate class
3. Lazy initialization where possible

### PipelineExecutor (cli/pipeline.py)
- **Size**: 2171 lines
- **Issues**:
  - Mixes CLI concerns with execution logic
  - Complex interactive mode handling
  - Multiple execution paths

**Suggestions**:
1. Separate CLI handling from execution logic
2. Extract interactive mode to separate module
3. Use strategy pattern for execution modes

## 6. Specific Refactoring Recommendations

### High Priority (Complexity > 30)

1. **Split DAGExecutor.executeDAG**:
   ```python
   # Current: Monolithic execute method
   # Proposed: Separate phases
   class DAGExecutor:
       async def execute(self, context, steps):
           validated_steps = await self._validate_phase(steps)
           prepared_context = await self._prepare_phase(context, validated_steps)
           return await self._execution_phase(prepared_context, validated_steps)
   ```

2. **Simplify PluginInputResolver**:
   ```python
   # Current: Complex nested conditionals
   # Proposed: Chain of input sources
   class InputSourceChain:
       def __init__(self, sources: List[InputSource]):
           self.sources = sources
       
       def resolve(self, field_name: str) -> Optional[Any]:
           for source in self.sources:
               if value := source.get(field_name):
                   return value
           return None
   ```

3. **Extract Progress Reporting**:
   ```python
   # Current: Duplicated progress logic
   # Proposed: Centralized reporter
   class ProgressReporter:
       def __init__(self, task_manager, callback=None):
           self.task_manager = task_manager
           self.callback = callback
       
       def report(self, step_name: str, status: StepStatus, **kwargs):
           # Centralized reporting logic
   ```

### Medium Priority

1. **Simplify Context Hierarchy**:
   - Merge ExecutionContext and PipelineContext
   - Remove EnhancedContext
   - Use clear interfaces for context capabilities

2. **Refactor Plugin System**:
   - Replace inheritance with composition
   - Use plugin capabilities/features instead of base classes
   - Simplify plugin discovery

3. **Break Down Large Classes**:
   - Split ArtifactManager into FileManager + MetadataManager
   - Split TaskManager into StateManager + HistoryManager + ProgressTracker
   - Extract interactive logic from CLI modules

## 7. Code Smells to Address

1. **Long Parameter Lists**: Methods with 5+ parameters
2. **Feature Envy**: Classes accessing other classes' internals
3. **Primitive Obsession**: Using dicts/strings instead of domain objects
4. **Shotgun Surgery**: Changes requiring updates in many places
5. **God Classes**: Classes doing too much

## 8. Testing Considerations

Before refactoring:
1. Ensure comprehensive test coverage for complex methods
2. Add integration tests for critical paths
3. Create performance benchmarks for optimization targets
4. Document current behavior thoroughly

## Conclusion

The codebase shows signs of organic growth with accumulated complexity. The main issues are:
- Monolithic methods that violate single responsibility
- Complex state management across multiple contexts
- Deep inheritance hierarchies in the plugin system
- Poor separation between CLI, business logic, and infrastructure

Addressing these issues systematically will improve maintainability, testability, and developer experience.
