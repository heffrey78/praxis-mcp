# Phase 4: Async Management Implementation

## Overview
This phase introduces proper async resource management and centralized event loop handling, addressing technical debt around AsyncIO usage and resource cleanup.

## Changes Made

### 1. AsyncContextManager (`src/core/async_context.py`)
- **AsyncResourceManager**: Tracks and cleans up async resources
- **AsyncExecutionContext**: Context manager for async operations with proper lifecycle
- **ManagedEventLoop**: Manages event loops with proper cleanup
- Automatic task cancellation on context exit
- Error handler registration for centralized error handling

### 2. EventLoopManager (`src/core/event_loop_manager.py`)
- Singleton service for centralized event loop management
- Thread-safe loop creation and management
- Automatic cleanup on shutdown
- Executor registration for cleanup tracking
- AsyncTaskManager for task lifecycle management

### 3. Updated Components
- **InteractivePipelineExecutor**: Now uses async_context for proper resource management
- **PipelineExecutor**: Registers with EventLoopManager for cleanup
- **pipeline.py**: Uses centralized event loop manager instead of thread-local storage

## Benefits

### Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup of resources on context exit
- Proper task cancellation and cleanup
- No more resource leaks from unclosed loops or tasks

### Error Handling
- Centralized error handling with registered handlers
- Proper error propagation in async contexts
- Better debugging with contextual information

### Thread Safety
- Thread-safe event loop management
- Proper loop isolation between threads
- Automatic cleanup of thread-specific loops

### Testing
- Easier to test async code with proper lifecycle management
- Mock-friendly design with dependency injection
- Comprehensive test coverage for all async components

## Usage Examples

### Using AsyncExecutionContext
```python
async with async_context("MyOperation") as ctx:
    # Register resources for cleanup
    await ctx.register_resource(my_resource)
    
    # Create tracked tasks
    task = ctx.create_task(my_coroutine())
    
    # Gather multiple operations
    results = await ctx.gather(coro1(), coro2(), coro3())
    
    # Resources and tasks are automatically cleaned up on exit
```

### Using EventLoopManager
```python
# Get the global loop manager
loop_manager = get_loop_manager()

# Get or create event loop for current thread
loop = loop_manager.get_event_loop()

# Run coroutine with proper handling
result = loop_manager.run_coroutine(my_coroutine())

# Managed loop context
with loop_manager.managed_loop() as loop:
    # Use loop safely
    pass
```

### Using AsyncTaskManager
```python
task_manager = AsyncTaskManager()

# Create and track tasks
task = task_manager.create_task(my_coroutine(), name="my-task")

# Wait for all tasks with timeout
await task_manager.wait_all(timeout=30.0)

# Cancel all tasks
task_manager.cancel_all()

# Clean up everything
await task_manager.cleanup()
```

## Test Coverage
- 38 comprehensive tests covering all async management components
- Tests for resource cleanup, task management, error handling
- Thread safety and concurrency tests
- 100% test coverage for new components

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Code
1. Replace direct `asyncio.get_event_loop()` calls with `get_loop_manager().get_event_loop()`
2. Use `async_context` for operations that create tasks or manage resources
3. Register long-lived resources with the context for automatic cleanup
4. Use AsyncTaskManager for complex task management scenarios

### Best Practices
1. Always use async context managers for resource management
2. Register cleanup callbacks for custom resources
3. Use task names for better debugging
4. Set appropriate timeouts for operations
5. Handle cancellation properly in long-running tasks

## Next Phase
Phase 5 will focus on configuration objects, replacing context dictionaries with typed configuration classes for better type safety and validation.
