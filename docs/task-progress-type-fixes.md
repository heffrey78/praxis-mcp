# Task Progress - Type Fixes

## Fix Complex Type Issues in Loop Execution and DAG Executor

### Type Issues Found:

1. **src/core/loop_execution_strategy.py**:
   - Line 12: Cannot assign None to ExecutionContext type (when import fails)
   - Line 73: Variable not allowed in type expression (ExecutionContext used as type)
   - Lines 108, 119, 173, 227, 237, 338, 358: Accessing protected member `_data`
   - Lines 173, 93-94: Accessing protected member `_loop_iteration_index`

2. **src/core/dag_executor.py**:
   - Line 720: Cannot access attribute `_pipeline_context` for class PipelineContext
   - Line 724: Accessing protected member `_data`
   - Line 726: PipelineContext does not have `get_all` method
   - Line 797: PipelineContext does not have `extras` attribute

3. **src/core/execution_context.py**:
   - Line 94: Condition always evaluates to False (`self._pipeline_context is None`)
   - The issue is that `_pipeline_context` is a required field in the dataclass

### Resolution Plan:

1. Fix import handling in loop_execution_strategy.py
2. Create proper type annotations and avoid using variables in type expressions
3. Replace protected member access with public methods:
   - Use `get_data()` instead of `._data`
   - Use `get_loop_iteration_index()` instead of `._loop_iteration_index`
   - Add proper type guards for ExecutionContext vs PipelineContext
4. Fix the condition check in ExecutionContext's __post_init__
5. Handle context type differences properly in DAG executor
